# Creating-Decision-Tree-With-Classification
Data Mining Application

The aim of our project is to create a decision tree used in Data Mining with the method of classification.

Data mining can allow us to estimate the relationship in the future the great piles of data is searched using a computer program.
Classification is the main subject of our project (Classification) is the computer science and business intelligence data mining is used in the common workspace as a method of discipline. 

A data set for data mining is what we need. We need to make these data sets appropriate to the study of data mining. Processes for the preparation of the data, respectively: blank, missing data clean dirty data clearing collapse to perform the operation. In our project, we used the technique of filling in the filling of missing data with the average. After the data is prepared, we run the sorting algorithm (Classification). We used the    C 4.5 algorithm, which is one of classification algorithms. This algorithm results in the operation of branches and the leaves have achieved a composed decision tree.

As a result of our project consists of a decision tree we can offer visually. This decision tree provides support for the decision to be given according to the data of the areas and sectors.
